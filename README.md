## Planes

<br>

### Surface

What will the product actually look like, what colors, what typography, what images/design elements, what animation, what transitions, how will the final product look like?

<br>

### Skeleton

(How the infomation implemented), (how will the user navigate), (how the content relate to each other, low, mid top priority, how and where to position content)?

<br>

### Structure

How is the information, logically grouped, the feature the elements the data?

The data model built for this project laid the foundation for how the app should work and from this point forward, all that is needed, is to get hacking.

1. The ability to handle API HTTP errors gracefully.
2. The ability to handle API Errors gracefully.
3. The ability for admin to be able to delete user content.
4. Email capability.
5. All database models.

#### Desired features

Agile Development:

   -  Agile development methodology was used for this project, planning, developing, and delivering in small sprints. There were 2 Epic's in total spaced out over 15 days with:
      -  epic 1 - 2/3 of the total time.
      -  epic 2 - 1/3 of the total time.

      <br>

   I assigned all epics labels and I prioritized all sprints according to their labeling.

      -  must-have.
      -  should have.
      -  could have.
      -  nice to have.
