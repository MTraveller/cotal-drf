## Planes

<br>

### Surface

What will the product actually look like, what colors, what typography, what images/design elements, what animation, what transitions, how will the final product look like?

<br>

### Skeleton

(How the infomation implemented), (how will the user navigate), (how the content relate to each other, low, mid top priority, how and where to position content)?

<br>

### Structure

How is the information, logically grouped, the feature the elements the data?

The data model built for this project laid the foundation for how the app should work and from this point forward, all that is needed, is to get hacking.

### Deploy

1. #### Development and Production

-  This project was chosen to be hosted on render.com, if you choose to host else where please consult the docs of that host. Choosing to host on render then follow the steps below.
   <br>

   First create a folder anywhere you want to work with this repo. Inside this folder, follow the steps below.

   1. In a terminal window do: `git clone https://github.com/MTraveller/cotal-drf.git`
   2. cd into folder
   3. install [GitHub cli](https://cli.github.com "cli.github.com") if you don't have it.
   4. Do: `gh repo create` - follow instruction "Choose: No license, no readme - just create an  empty repo".
      <br>
      1. Choose not to clone locally then continue the below assuming you are inside the working folder.
      <!-- Step 3 - the repo you just created! -->
      2. Do: `git remote add origin https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git`
         1. if you get an fatal: error.
         2. Do: `rm -rf .git`
         3. Do: `git init` and `git remote add origin https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git`
         4. Do: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
      3. Do: `git branch -M main`
      4. Do: `git push -u origin main`
      5. Wait until files are uploaded, can take some time.
      6. Now this project is in your created repo.
      <br>
   1. Development:
      <!-- dev.py is automatically ignored by git -->
      1. Find and rename `cotal_drf_api/settings/dev_file_rename_to_just_dev.py` to dev.py
      2. Add a Django secret key from the provided website and add your cloudinary api `cloudinary://my_key:my_secret@my_cloud_name`.
      3. Open the terminal or a new one and cd to the cloned project folder.
      3. Do: `python` or `python3 install -r requirements.txt`
      4. Do: `python` or `python3 runserver 127.0.0.1:3000`
      5. You should now be able to open project on 127.0.0.1:3000
      <br>
   2. Production:
      1. Sign-in or signup for a [Render.com](https://render.com "render.com") account.
      2. Open `config/.env` file copy all variables and change accordingly in a new text document "keep it open".

      5. Create a new environment group for this project.
      6. Scroll down to "Secret Files" press "Add Secret" in key add: .env then press the eye and add all variables from the open text document you made in step 2 and save.
      7. In the same terminal window, or open a new one if closed and cd to project folder.
      8. Do: `git add .`
      9. Do: `git commit -m "Your Message"`
      10. Do: `git push -u origin main`
      11. Go to [render to add new blueprint](https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=blueprint "dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=blueprint")
      12. Connect your github account and give render access to the repo.
      13. Connect repo and choose service name and press apply.
